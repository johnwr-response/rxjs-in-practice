# RxJs In Practice

- Learn numerous RxJs Operators, learn all RxJs and Reactive Programming core concepts via Practical Examples
- This course is a complete practical guide for the RxJs library (Reactive Extensions for Javascript).
- The goal here is not to cover every single operator, but instead to choose an extended subset that contains the most commonly used operators, and provide practical examples for each.
- Another goal of the course is to show how RxJs is meant to be used for building programs using Reactive Design as opposed to an imperative programming style.
